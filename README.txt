-----For playing the game--------

Game only accesbile by launching it in Gamemaker studio 2.
Will change at some point, but for now this is how it is.
Simply click on Jetpack.yyp with GMS2 installed, and press F5 to run it.


Feel free to mess around with the code. 

------For messing around with the code-----
In obj_player, there is a create event with a ton of customizable variables.
You can probably guess what they are based on the names, so enjoy fiddling with them.


Have a good day!
