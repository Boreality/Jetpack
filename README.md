# Jetpack
Game I am currently working on about getting to the end as fast as possible through vaious hopefully in-depth methods such as 
propelling through the air with bullet recoil
A double jump, who's fumes are the only way to damage enemies
Oh yea enemies. They fly in place to get poofed by your jetpack
Oh yea a jetpack. Well thats really the same for the double jump. Or justification.
It is also keeping track of time. 
And a scoring system.

Currently only accecible by opening it in Gamemaker Studio 2
